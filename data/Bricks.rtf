Masonry is a form of construction that utilizes individual units, often in the form of bricks, which are laid and bound together by mortar. The strength, durability, and versatility of masonry have made it a popular choice for both structural and decorative elements in buildings across the globe. Bricks, a common type of masonry unit, are typically made from clay or concrete and are known for their high compressive strength and resistance to fire. They are used in a wide range of applications, including walls, foundations, arches, chimneys, and decorative facades. The use of masonry and bricks in construction offers numerous benefits, such as thermal mass, sound insulation, and resistance to pests and weathering. However, despite their robustness, masonry and brick structures are not immune to deterioration over time, necessitating regular maintenance and repair.\
\
\\subsubsection\{Deterioration Mechanism of Masonry/Bricks\}\
Masonry and brick structures, while known for their durability and strength, are susceptible to various deterioration mechanisms. These mechanisms can be broadly categorized into \\mybold\{physical\}, \\mybold\{chemical\}, and \\mybold\{biological processes\}, each contributing to the degradation and reduced longevity of the material. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for the maintenance, preservation, and restoration of masonry and brick buildings.\
\
Each of these deterioration mechanisms involves complex interactions between the masonry material, the environment, and, in the case of biological decay, living organisms. Addressing these effects requires a comprehensive understanding of the underlying causes and the implementation of appropriate protective measures, such as the use of water repellents, proper drainage, compatible repair materials, and regular maintenance.\
\
\\subsubsubsection\{Physical Deterioration\}\
The physical deterioration of bricks in masonry structures is driven by environmental factors and inherent material vulnerabilities. The primary mechanisms include freeze-thaw cycles, thermal expansion, salt crystallization, and mechanical erosion, each contributing to the degradation in unique ways. Understanding these processes is crucial for preserving the structural integrity and aesthetic qualities of masonry buildings.\
\
\\mybold\{Freeze-Thaw Cycles\}: Freeze-thaw cycles pose a significant threat to brick masonry, where water infiltration and subsequent freezing lead to expansion that stresses the brick structure. This cycle can cause spalling and cracking, weakening the masonry over time. Studies like those conducted by \\cite\{yue_study_2022\} using SEM technology reveal how moisture content critically influences brick deterioration under these conditions. Their findings highlight the importance of managing moisture to mitigate damage from freeze-thaw cycles.\
\
\
\\mybold\{Thermal Expansion\}: Thermal expansion affects brick masonry as fluctuations in temperature cause the material to expand and contract. This movement can induce stresses, particularly when constrained, leading to cracks and compromising structural integrity.  \\cite\{zhou_degradation_2020\} explored the impact of thermal stresses on refractory bricks in cement kilns, emphasizing the dual challenges of thermal and chemical deterioration mechanisms.\
\
\\mybold\{Salt Crystallization\}: Salt crystallization is particularly destructive, with salts deposited within brick pores crystallizing and exerting expansive pressures that disrupt the structure. \\cite\{simonsen_quantifying_2020\} have developed methods to quantify such deterioration through innovative surface coloring and the point count method, providing a valuable tool for assessing salt-induced damage.\
\
\\mybold\{Mechanical Erosion\}: Mechanical erosion results from physical wear and abrasion, which can remove material from the brick surface, reducing its size and altering its shape. This erosion can be exacerbated by human activities or natural forces like wind or water flow. \\cite\{alexakis_damage_2020\} utilized acoustic emission techniques to detect and analyze the onset of mechanical damage in brick masonry under cyclic loading, suggesting methods for real-time monitoring of such deterioration.\
\
Other research efforts have also contributed valuable insights into the deterioration of brick masonry. For instance, the use of high-resolution micro-CT by \\cite\{reedy_3d_2020\} enhances the understanding of porosity and its effects on brick durability. Orthophoto imaging techniques employed by \\cite\{li_assessment_2023\} offer detailed visual assessments of decay, aiding in targeted conservation efforts. Further, the innovative approaches to analyzing environmental and material impacts on brick masonry by \\cite\{bompa_compressive_2020\} through digital image correlation underscore the complex interplay of moisture and mechanical properties.\
\
In summary, the deterioration of brick masonry is a multifaceted issue influenced by various physical and environmental factors. Each mechanism, from freeze-thaw cycles and thermal expansion to salt crystallization and mechanical erosion, necessitates specific research and targeted mitigation strategies to preserve these structures effectively.

\\subsubsubsection\{Chemical Deterioration\}\
\
The chemical deterioration of bricks in masonry structures is predominantly influenced by environmental and chemical factors such as Acid Rain, Alkali-Silica Reaction (ASR), and Carbonation. These chemical processes contribute to the degradation of the physical and mechanical properties of bricks, affecting their durability and structural integrity.\
\
\\mybold\{Acid Rain\}: Acid rain significantly impacts brick masonry by accelerating material degradation through chemical reactions. Studies by \\cite\{zheng_mechanical_2019\} and  \\cite\{zeng_deterioration_2018\} have detailed how acid rain leads to a reduction in mechanical strengths and the decomposition of vital masonry compounds, respectively. Additionally, \\cite\{olowofoyeku_non-destructive_2021\} utilized UPV, and RH to monitor the extent of damage in concrete under similar acidic conditions, highlighting the adaptability of these methods in evaluating deterioration progression.\
\
\\mybold\{Alkali-Silica Reaction (ASR)\}: ASR is another critical concern, where reactive silica in the bricks reacts with alkalis from cement and moisture to form a gel that swells, causing cracking and expansion. \\cite\{rivard_assessing_2009\} applied methods like ultrasonic wave velocities and dynamic Young's modulus to assess ASR damage, finding correlations between UPV and the static Young's modulus of deteriorated structures.\
\
\
\\mybold\{Carbonation\}: Carbonation occurs when carbon dioxide in the air reacts with calcium hydroxide in the bricks to form calcium carbonate, reducing the pH and enhancing the susceptibility to corrosion. Techniques like pH and silicon measurements have been effectively used to assess the depth of carbonation and its effects on brick masonry, as demonstrated by \\cite\{rorig-dalgaard_evaluation_2021\}.\

\
\
\\subsubsubsection\{Biological Deterioration\}\
Biological deterioration of bricks is a natural process that occurs when living organisms such as bacteria, fungi, lichens, mosses, and higher plants colonize and interact with the brick material. This interaction can lead to physical and chemical changes in the brick, resulting in discoloration, structural damage, and ultimately, degradation of the building\'92s integrity. The extent and rate of this deterioration depend on several factors, including the type of organism, the environmental conditions, and the properties of the brick itself.\
\
\\mybold\{Microbial Growth\}: Microbial growth on bricks, particularly bacteria and fungi, can lead to significant deterioration. For instance, \'91Living\'92 bricks made from bacteria and fungi have been shown to heal themselves and send signals to each other, serving as building blocks for sturdy structures \\cite\{noauthor_its_nodate\}. In another study, the Build-Mat Bio-test (BMB test) was used to evaluate the impact of bacterial culture (Escherichia coli) on cementitious matrices, showing more intense deterioration and higher alteration kinetics compared to the medium without microorganisms and to the synthetic acid solution \\cite\{magniont_new_2011\}. Furthermore, microbial growth under limiting conditions has been discussed, highlighting the need for further studies to understand microorganisms under these conditions \\cite\{gonzalez_microbial_2023\}.\
\
\\mybold\{Plant Growth\}: Plant growth, including lichens, mosses, and higher plants, can also contribute to the biodeterioration of bricks. These organisms can cause physical damage through root penetration and chemical damage through the release of organic acids. A study discussed the role of these organisms in the biodeterioration of historic buildings, highlighting the need for further studies to examine the relationship between colonizing organisms, intrinsic elements of the substrate, and external factors \\cite\{cozzolino_role_2022\}. Another study used LEGO bricks to create engineered environments for the study of cm-scale biological systems, specifically plant roots, providing insights into the interaction between plants and brick-like structures \\cite\{lind_lego_2014\}.\
